# Bug Fix: Logical Operator Error in pndriftHCT_forMarcus.m

## Issue
The refactored code in `pndriftHCT_forMarcus.m` line 223 used the logical OR operator `||` which requires scalar operands. This caused a runtime error when `varargin{1, 1}.sol` was an array (from a previous solution).

### Error Message
```
Operands to the logical AND (&&) and OR (||) operators must be convertible to logical scalar values. 
Use the ANY or ALL functions to reduce operands to logical scalar values.

Error in pndriftHCT_forMarcus/pdex4ic (line 223)
        if isempty(varargin) || any(varargin{1, 1}.sol == 0)
```

### Root Cause
When `varargin{1, 1}.sol` is a 3D array (time × space × variables), the comparison `varargin{1, 1}.sol == 0` returns an array of boolean values, not a scalar. The `||` operator cannot handle this.

## Solution
Changed the logical OR operator `||` to the bitwise OR operator `|` on line 223.

### Before (Incorrect)
```matlab
if length(varargin) == 0 || varargin{1, 1}.sol == 0
```

### After (Correct)
```matlab
if length(varargin) == 0 | varargin{1, 1}.sol == 0
```

## Explanation
The single pipe `|` (bitwise OR) operator in MATLAB can handle array operands, while the double pipe `||` (logical OR) requires scalar operands. This matches the original working code in `pndriftHCT.m` line 201.

### How it works:
1. When `length(varargin) == 0` is true, the expression short-circuits and returns true
2. When `length(varargin) > 0` and `varargin{1, 1}.sol` is scalar 0, the comparison works fine
3. When `varargin{1, 1}.sol` is an array, the `|` operator can handle the array result from the comparison

## Files Modified
- `functions/pndriftHCT_forMarcus.m` (line 223)

## Testing
Since MATLAB is not available in the testing environment, the fix has been verified by:
1. Comparing with the original working code in `pndriftHCT.m`
2. Understanding the data flow from `EquilibratePNHCT_forMarcus.m`
3. Confirming the logical correctness of using `|` vs `||`
