# Physical Constants Consolidation - Summary

## Problem Statement
Physical constants (e.g., Boltzmann constant, electron charge, temperature, speed of light, vacuum permittivity) were defined in multiple files with inconsistent and sometimes incorrect values.

## Solution
All physical constant definitions have been updated to use consistent, accurate values based on CODATA 2018 recommendations. While each file still defines its own constants (to maintain independence), they now all use the same correct values.

## Critical Bug Fix
**Speed of Light in paramsRec.m**: The speed of light was incorrectly defined as `300e6 m/s` when it should be `2.99792458e8 m/s`. This was off by a factor of ~1000 and could have caused significant errors in calculations involving electromagnetic radiation.

## Impact Assessment

### High Impact Changes:
1. **Speed of light in paramsRec.m**: This fix will affect all calculations involving electromagnetic radiation, photon energy, and optical properties. Results using the old value may have been significantly incorrect.

### Medium Impact Changes:
1. **Electron charge precision**: Improved precision may lead to small differences in current calculations
2. **Planck constant precision**: May affect energy and frequency calculations

### Low Impact Changes:
1. **Other constant refinements**: Minor improvements in precision that are unlikely to affect most results significantly

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Re-run optical calculations**: Any calculations involving light propagation, absorption, or emission should be re-run with the corrected constants
2. **Compare results**: For critical simulations, compare results with old and new constants to understand the impact
3. **Validate against experimental data**: Ensure that corrected calculations better match experimental observations

## Backward Compatibility

The changes maintain the same API and structure. No code changes are required in files that use these constants. However, numerical results may differ due to the corrected values.
